## Projects  

- **Medicinal Leaf Classifier**  
  Full-stack ML application for identifying medicinal plants from leaf images.  
  → Built using CNNs (TensorFlow/Keras), deployed on **Flask + Render** with REST API support.  

- **House Price Prediction**  
  Machine learning pipeline for property price estimation with **feature engineering, Model prediction**.  

- **Neural Networks from Scratch**  
  Low-level implementations of **feedforward, backpropagation, and gradient descent** without high-level ML libraries — focusing on mathematical rigor.  

- **Data Science Projects Collection**  
  Repository of applied mini-projects covering **EDA, preprocessing pipelines, ML model training, and visualization dashboards**.
